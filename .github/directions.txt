Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install Django: Use pip to install Django (pip install django).
Step 2: Create a New Django Project and App

Create a new Django project: Run django-admin startproject flashcard_app.
Create a new app: Inside the project directory, run python manage.py startapp flashcards.
Step 3: Define Your Models

Open the models.py file in the flashcards app.
Define models for Deck and Card, with necessary fields like title, prompt, answer, and relationships between them.
Step 4: Set Up Database and Migrations

Run python manage.py makemigrations to generate migrations.
Run python manage.py migrate to apply migrations and create database tables.
Step 5: Create URLs and Views

Define URLs for creating decks, viewing decks, and quizzing in the urls.py of the flashcards app.
Create corresponding views (using Django's class-based views or function-based views).
Step 6: Create HTML Templates

Create HTML templates for creating decks, viewing decks, and the quiz interface.
Use Django template language to integrate dynamic content from the backend.
Step 7: Implement JavaScript for Flipping Cards

Add JavaScript to toggle card visibility and simulate flipping.
Use event listeners to handle card marking (success/failure) and AJAX requests to update card status.
Step 8: Implement Card Shuffling

Use JavaScript to randomize the order of cards within a deck.
Consider implementing the Leitner system for scheduling card reviews.
Step 9: Implement User Authentication

Use Django's built-in authentication system to handle user registration and login.
Secure views with the @login_required decorator.
Step 10: Create Forms for Adding Decks and Cards

Define Django forms for adding decks and cards.
Use these forms in your templates to provide an easy-to-use interface for users.
Step 11: Handle Form Submissions and Record Data

Process form submissions in Django views.
Save new decks and cards to the database and associate them with the logged-in user.
Step 12: Styling with CSS

Create a stylesheet to style your templates.
Apply CSS to make your application visually appealing and user-friendly.
Step 13: Testing and Debugging

Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
Debug any issues that arise during testing.
Step 14: Deployment (Optional)

Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
Configure your environment for production.
Deploy your Django application.
Remember that this guide provides a high-level overview of the steps involved. Each step may require additional details and code implementation specific to your project. It's also a good idea to refer to Django's official documentation and other relevant resources as you work through the process.
